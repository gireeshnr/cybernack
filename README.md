## clone or download
```terminal
$ git clone https://github.com/amazingandyyy/mern.git
$ yarn # or npm i
```

## project structure

   .env (to create .env, check [prepare your secret session])
client/
   package.json
...
```

# Usage (run fullstack app on your machine)

## Prerequisites
- [MongoDB](https://gist.github.com/nrollr/9f523ae17ecdbb50311980503409aeb3)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) ^10.0.0
- [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/)

notice, you need client and server runs concurrently in different terminal session, in order to make them talk to each other

## Client-side usage(PORT: 3000)
```terminal
$ cd client          // go to client folder
$ yarn # or npm i    // npm install packages
$ npm run dev        // run it locally

// deployment for client app
$ npm run build // this will compile the react code using webpack and generate a folder called docs in the root level
$ npm run start // this will run the files in docs, this behavior is exactly the same how gh-pages will run your static site
```

## Server-side usage(PORT: 8000)

### Prepare your secret

run the script at the first level:

(You need to add a JWT_SECRET in .env to connect to MongoDB)

```terminal
// in the root level
$ cd server
$ echo "JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET" >> src/.env
```

### Start

```terminal
$ cd server   // go to server folder
$ npm i       // npm install packages
$ npm run dev // run it locally
$ npm run build // this will build the server code to es5 js codes and generate a dist file
```

## Deploy Server to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
```terminal
$ npm i -g heroku
$ heroku login
...
$ heroku create
$ npm run heroku:add <your-super-amazing-heroku-app>
// remember to run this command in the root level, not the server level, so if you follow the documentation along, you may need to do `cd ..`
$ pwd
/Users/<your-name>/mern
$ npm run deploy:heroku
```

### After creating heroku

if using webpack:
remember to update the file of [client/webpack.prod.js](https://github.com/amazingandyyy/mern/blob/master/client/webpack.prod.js)
```javascript
 'API_URI': JSON.stringify('https://your-super-amazing-heroku-app.herokuapp.com')
```
if using parcel
remember to update the file of [client/.env.production](https://github.com/amazingandyyy/mern/blob/master/client/.env.production.js)
```
 REACT_APP_API_URI=https://your-super-amazing-heroku-app.herokuapp.com
```

 Asset Management and OS Distribution System
Project Overview
This project aims to provide a comprehensive asset management system with a focus on network scanning and OS distribution visualization. The system leverages various scanning tools to discover assets, gather detailed information about them, and present this data in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

Recent Achievements
Integration of Nmap Scanning: Implemented the Nmap scanning feature to perform detailed network scans. The scans include service detection, OS detection, and more.
Scan Result Visualization: Developed components to visualize scan results, particularly focusing on OS distribution across discovered assets.
Improved Data Fetching and Display: Enhanced the backend to fetch scan results correctly and updated the frontend to display these results accurately.
Error Handling and Logging: Improved error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure robustness and easier debugging.
Key Components
Backend
NmapScanResult Model

Schema to store Nmap scan results.
Fields include organization, user, scan information, run statistics, and additional fields for storing raw XML data.
Nmap Service

runNmapScan(domain): Executes the Nmap scan command.
saveNmapScanResult(orgId, userId, domain, scanData): Saves the Nmap scan results to the database and updates or creates the corresponding asset.
Asset Controller

getAssetDetail: Fetches asset details and associated scan results, including the newly implemented OS details extraction.
Frontend
OSDistributionChart Component

Utilizes the Chart.js library to display a pie chart of OS distribution based on scan results.
Parses raw XML data from scan results to extract OS information.
AssetDetailView Component

Displays detailed information about a selected asset, including network information, OS distribution, and scan history.
Integrates the OSDistributionChart component to visualize OS distribution.
Utilities
ChartSetup.js
Registers necessary components for Chart.js to work seamlessly with the application.
API Utils
API Functions
fetchAssetDetail(assetId): Fetches detailed information about an asset, including its scan results.
Additional API calls for asset management, including fetching assets, auto discovery, and updating assets.
